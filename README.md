C++ Projects for School and Self
================

Various programming projects for learning C++. Included thus far (and planned) are projects including:

  ~ School Practice and Assignments (Advanced Programming Concepts with C++)
  
  ~ Project Euler
  
  ~ Daily Programmer
  
  ~ Stuff I came up with to try something.

I'm wrapping my head around C++ still, so excuse the poor style. At this point I'm most familiar with Java and Python.
